Description
This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between the age of fathers and fertility outcomes using data from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) in the UK. The data spans over 40 years and provides a comprehensive view of reproductive health. This analysis is crucial due to the limited data on male fertility and its impact on child health. The project will involve data cleaning, constructing a panel dataset, and performing statistical analyses such as regression discontinuity. The results will be visualized using a Power BI dashboard.
